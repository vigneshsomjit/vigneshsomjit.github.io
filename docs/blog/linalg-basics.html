<section id="vector-spaces-vectors-and-matrices" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="vector-spaces-vectors-and-matrices">Vector Spaces, Vectors, and Matrices</h2>
<p>In mathematics, an <strong>algebraic structure</strong> is an abstraction consisting of (i) a set of elements, (ii) operations that manipulate those elements, and (iii) axioms that the operations must satisfy. The power of this abstraction is that once the core properties of the structure are formalized in general, they can be applied to any specific system — mathematical or real-world — that shares the same structure. For example, the <strong>field</strong> <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> is an algebraic structure consisting of elements called <strong>scalars</strong> with operations of addition and multiplication that satisfy a number of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics)">axioms</a>. A ubiquitous field is the set of real numbers <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Linear algebra is the study of <strong>vector spaces</strong> <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>, which is an algebraic structure defined in the context of a field. The elements in a vector space are called <strong>vectors</strong>. For any two vectors <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol u,\boldsymbol v \in V\)</span>, the operation of <strong>vector addition</strong> creates a third vector <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol u + \boldsymbol v \in V\)</span>; this is known as <strong>closure</strong> under vector addition. For any scalar <span class="math inline">\(c \in F\)</span> and vector <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol u \in V\)</span>, the operation of <strong>scalar multiplication</strong> creates another vector <span class="math inline">\(c \boldsymbol u \in V\)</span>; this is known as <strong>closure</strong> under scalar multiplication. The 8 axioms that govern these two operations are listed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space">here</a>.</p>
<p>Any sets of elements equipped with vector addition and scalar multiplication that satisfy the closure property and the 8 axioms is considered a vector space. Of particular interest are <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-tuples of the form</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\boldsymbol u = (u_1, u_2, \ldots, u_n),
\]</span></p>
<p>where the <strong>components</strong> <span class="math inline">\(u_1, \ldots, u_n\)</span> are scalars from a field <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>. The set of all such <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-tuples is denoted by <span class="math inline">\(F^n\)</span>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> For example, <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^3\)</span> is the set of all 3-tuples of real numbers. Here, vector addition is defined as the component-wise operation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
\boldsymbol u = (u_1, u_2, &amp;\ldots, u_n) \in F^n \quad\text{and}\quad \boldsymbol v = (v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n) \in F^n \\
\\
\boldsymbol u + \boldsymbol v &amp;= (u_1 + v_1, u_2 + v_2, \ldots, u_n + v_n) \in F^n.
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>Similarly, scalar multiplication is defined as the component-wise operation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
c \in F \quad&amp;\text{and}\quad \boldsymbol u = (u_1,u_2, \ldots, u_n) \in F^n \\
\\
c \boldsymbol u &amp;= (c u_1, c u_2, \ldots, c u_n) \in F^n.
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>A natural generalization of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-tuples is the <span class="math inline">\(m \times n\)</span> array called the <strong>matrix</strong>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\mathbf A = \begin{pmatrix}
a_{11} &amp; a_{12} &amp; \ldots &amp; a_{1n} \\
a_{21} &amp; a_{22} &amp; \ldots &amp; a_{2n} \\
\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
a_{m1} &amp; a_{m2} &amp; \ldots &amp; a_{mn}
\end{pmatrix}, \quad a_{ij} \in F.
\]</span></p>
<p>The set of all <span class="math inline">\(m \times n\)</span> matrices with components in a field <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> is denoted by <span class="math inline">\(F^{m \times n}\)</span>. Vector addition and scalar multiplication are defined analogously to the component-wise operations for <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-tuples. Specifically, for any two matrices <span class="math inline">\(A, B \in F^{m \times n}\)</span>, vector addition creates a third matrix <span class="math inline">\(A + B \in F^{m \times n}\)</span> whose components are given by</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
(\mathbf{A} + \mathbf B)_{ij} = \mathbf A_{ij} + \mathbf B_{ij}.
\]</span></p>
<p>For any scalar <span class="math inline">\(c \in F\)</span>, scalar multiplication creates another matrix <span class="math inline">\(cA \in F^{m \times n}\)</span> where</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
c \mathbf A_{ij} = c (\mathbf A_{ij}).
\]</span></p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="basis-and-dimension">Basis and Dimension</h2>
<p>A vector space <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> contains infinitely many vectors. We are interested in finding a smaller set of vectors that captures the entire structure in a much more tractable manner. For example, consider the vector space <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^3\)</span> in <a href="#fig-3d" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;1</a>. It seems like any point (i.e.&nbsp;vector or 3-tuple) on the blue lattice structure can be described by how far it extends along the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> axes. This section formalizes this idea.</p>

<section id="linear-combination-span-and-linear-independence" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="linear-combination-span-and-linear-independence">Linear Combination, Span, and Linear Independence</h3>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A} = \{\boldsymbol{u}_1, \ldots, \boldsymbol{u}_n\}\)</span> be some finite subset of vectors in <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>. One way to formalize the idea of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span> capturing the <em>entire</em> structure of <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> is if any vector <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{v} \in V\)</span> can be expressed as a <strong>linear combination</strong> of the vectors in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\boldsymbol v = c_1 \boldsymbol u_1 + c_2 \boldsymbol u_2 + \ldots + c_n \boldsymbol u_n = \sum_{i=1}^n c_i \boldsymbol u_i \in V,
\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(c_1, \ldots, c_n \in F\)</span>. If this is the case, then we say that the set <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span> <strong>spans</strong> the vector space <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>. An equivalent characterization is that the set of all linear combinations of the vectors in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span> — the <strong>span</strong> of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span> — is equal to <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>.</p>
<p>We are also interested in efficiency. That is to say, we want <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span> to be as small as possible while still spanning <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>. We call a set of vectors <strong>linearly dependent</strong> if one of the vectors can be expressed as a linear combination of the others. More formally, the vectors <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{u}_1, \ldots, \boldsymbol{u}_n\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span> would be linearly dependent if</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
c_1 \boldsymbol u_1 + c_2 \boldsymbol u_2 + \ldots + c_n \boldsymbol u_n = 0,
\]</span></p>
<p>and not all of the <span class="math inline">\(c_i\)</span> are zero. Thus, we would like to remove any linearly dependent vectors from <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span>: such vectors are going to be redundant since they will be a part of the span of the other vectors in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span>. Formally, we say that the vectors <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{u}_1, \ldots, \boldsymbol{u}_n\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span> are <strong>linearly independent</strong> if</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
c_1 \boldsymbol u_1 + c_2 \boldsymbol u_2 + \ldots + c_n \boldsymbol u_n = 0,
\]</span></p>
<p>only if <span class="math inline">\(c_1 = c_2 = \ldots = c_n = 0\)</span>.</p>
<p>Taken together, these two ideas — spanning and linear independence — gives us exactly what we were looking for: a minimal yet complete description of the vector space <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>. More formally, we call a set of vectors a <strong>basis</strong> <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{B}\)</span> for the vector space <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> if it is a linearly independent subset that spans <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>. The vectors in a basis are called <strong>basis vectors</strong>.</p>
</section>
<section id="dimension" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="dimension">Dimension</h3>
<p>Notice that in the above definition of the basis set <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{B}\)</span>, we did not assume that the number of basis vectors is finite. In fact, there exists vector spaces that require infinitely many basis vectors. For example, an <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-degree <strong>polynomial</strong> is defined as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
f(x) = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \ldots + a_1 x + a_0,
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is a variable, <span class="math inline">\(a_i \in F\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(n \geq 0\)</span> is an integer. The vector space of all polynomials with coefficients in a field <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>, denoted <span class="math inline">\(P(F)\)</span>, has the infinite basis set</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\mathcal{B}_{P(F)} = \{1, x, x^2, x^3, \ldots\}.
\]</span> Nevertheless, note that the definition of linear combination requires a finite number of vectors. Thus, even if a basis set <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{B}\)</span> for a vector space <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> is infinite, any vector <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol v \in V\)</span> can be represented as a linear combination of a finite subset of vectors in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{B}\)</span>.</p>
<p>To distinguish between vector spaces with finite and infinite basis sets, we introduce the notion of <strong>dimension</strong>, which is simply the number of basis vectors in a basis set <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{B}\)</span> for the vector space <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>. If <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> has a finite basis, then we say that <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> is <strong>finite-dimensional</strong>; otherwise, it is <strong>infinite-dimensional</strong>.</p>
</section>
<section id="basis-sets-are-not-unique" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="basis-sets-are-not-unique">Basis Sets Are Not Unique</h3>
<p>An important property of basis sets is that they are not unique. Let us revisit the vector space <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^3\)</span> to illustrate this point. At the start of this section, I mentioned that it seems possible to describe any point in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^3\)</span> by how far it extends along the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> axes. With this intuition, we can define the following basis set</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\mathcal{B}_{\mathbb{R}^3} = \{(1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1)\} = \{\boldsymbol e_1, \boldsymbol e_2, \boldsymbol e_3\}.
\]</span></p>
<p>This is known as the <strong>standard basis</strong> for <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^3\)</span>. We can verify that it is a valid basis by confirming that (i) the three vectors are linearly independent and (ii) any vector <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol u = (u_1,u_2,u_3) \in \mathbb{R}^3\)</span> can be expressed as a linear combination of the basis vectors. As an example, the vectors <span class="math inline">\(w = (2,1.5,3)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(v=(-1.5,0.6, -1.2)\)</span> are plotted below.</p>

<p>However, any <em>any</em> set of three linearly independent vectors in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^3\)</span> that span <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^3\)</span> can serve as a basis.

<p>It is often useful to consider a lower-dimension vector space that still preserves the properties of the original vector space. Formally, for a vector space <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>, we define the <strong>subspace</strong> <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> to be any vector space that consists of a nonempty <em>subset</em> of the vectors in <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> endowed with the <em>same</em> operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication defined on <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>.</p>
<p>This definition can seem abstract at first, and so it’s valuable to walk through a concrete example. Consider the following subset of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^3\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
W = \{(x,y,0): x, y \in \mathbb{R}\} \subseteq {\mathbb{R^3}},

Figure&nbsp;4: A 2D plane through the origin is a subspace of R³.
</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
</div>
<p>The subset <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> is a subspace of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^3\)</span>. To see this, note that for any <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol u = (u_1, u_2, 0) \in W\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol v = (v_1, v_2, 0) \in W\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(c \in \mathbb{R}\)</span>, the component-wise definitions of vector addition and scalar multiplication for <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^3\)</span> are <strong>closed</strong> in <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
\boldsymbol u + \boldsymbol v = &amp;(u_1 + v_1, u_2 + v_2, 0) \in W \\
\\
c \boldsymbol u &amp;= (c u_1, c u_2, 0) \in W,
\end{aligned}
\]</span> and thus <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> is a valid vector space.</p>
<section id="importance-of-origin" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="importance-of-origin">Importance of Origin</h3>
<p>Notice that the origin <span class="math inline">\((0,0,0)\)</span> — the <strong>additive identity</strong> for <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^3\)</span> — is contained in <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span>. This is not a coincidence: every subspace of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^3\)</span> <em>must</em> contain the origin. To see this, consider the <span class="math inline">\(x-y\)</span> plane shifted up by one unit:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
W' = \{(x,y,1): x, y \in \mathbb{R}\} \subseteq {\mathbb{R^3}}.
\]</span></p>
<p>This set does not include the origin, and it fails to be a subspace because the operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication are not closed in <span class="math inline">\(W'\)</span>. Specifically, for any <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol u = (u_1, u_2, 1) \in W'\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol v = (v_1, v_2, 1) \in W'\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(c \in \{\mathbb{R} / 1\}\)</span>, we have that</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
\boldsymbol u + \boldsymbol v = &amp;(u_1 + v_1, u_2 + v_2, 2) \notin W' \\
\\
c \boldsymbol u &amp;= (c u_1, c u_2, c) \notin W',
\end{aligned}
\]</span> and so <span class="math inline">\(W'\)</span> is not a valid vector space. Importantly, this is a general property not limited to <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^3\)</span>: any subspace must contain the <strong>additive identity</strong> (also called the <strong>zero vector</strong>) of the parent vector space.</p>
</section>
<section id="basis-of-subspaces" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="basis-of-subspaces">Basis of Subspaces</h3>
<p>A general property of subspaces of a finite-dimensional vector space is that their dimension is less than the dimension of the parent vector space.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> For example, in the example above, a basis for the <span class="math inline">\(x-y\)</span> plane in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^3\)</span> is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\mathcal{B}_W = \{(1,0,0), (0,1,0)\}.
\]</span></p>
<p>Thus, the dimension of <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> is 2.</p>
