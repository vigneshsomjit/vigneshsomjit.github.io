    "text": "Linear Regression Can (Sometimes) Recover True Conditional Averages\nSo far, we have discussed linear regression as a tool to approximate the conditional expectation function. However, it can be shown that when the CEF is itself linear, the best linear predictor exactly equals the CEF. That is to say linear regression recovers the true conditional averages in this case.2\nTo see this in practice, I simulate data on income using the following equation\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nincome_i &= \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\times white_i + \\beta_2 \\times male_i \\\\ & \\quad \\quad + \\beta_3 \\times literacy_i^{(1+0.3 \\times sex_i)} + \\beta_4 (male_i \\times black_i) + \\varepsilon_i.\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\nShow the code that simulates the dataset.\nset.seed(123)\n\n# Population size \nn &lt;- 1000\n\n# Noise \nnoise &lt;- rnorm(n, 0, 2000)\n\n# Covariates \nmale &lt;- rbinom(n, 1, 0.5)\nsex &lt;- factor(male, labels = c(\"Female\", \"Male\"))\nwhite &lt;- rbinom(n, 1, 0.7)\nrace &lt;- factor(white, labels = c(\"Black\", \"White\"))\nliteracy &lt;- runif(n, 0, 100)\n\n# Outcome \nwhite_female_base &lt;- 30000                           # white females with 0 literacy earn 30000\nliteracy_effect &lt;- 50\nmale_premium &lt;- 200                                    # + 200 male premium \nwhite_premium &lt;- 1500                                  # + 1500 white premium\nwhite_male_premium &lt;- 1000                              # + 1000 white male premium \n\n# Create income \nincome &lt;- \n  white_female_base +\n  white_premium       * white +                          \n  male_premium        * male +                            \n  literacy_effect   * (literacy^(1 + 0.3 * male)) +    # literate males are better off than literate females \n  white_male_premium   * (male * white) +                  \n  noise\n\n# Combine into a dataset\nsim_data &lt;- data.frame(sex = sex,\n                     race = race,\n                     literacy,\n                     income)\n\n\n\nA Simple Univariate Example\nRecall from Equation 1 that the CEF is a function of the covariates we use to predict the outcome variable. So, as a simple example of a linear CEF, let us consider the conditional expectation of \\(income_i\\) as a function of \\(male_i\\). The conditional expectation can be written as the step-wise function \\[\n\\mathbb{E}[Y_i|male_i] = \\begin{cases} \\mu_0 \\quad  \\text{if} \\quad male_i = 0 \\\\ \\mu_1 \\quad  \\text{if} \\quad male_i = 1 \\end{cases}.\n\\tag{3}\\] To illustrate that Equation 3 is a linear combination of \\(male_i\\), we can rewrite it as\n\\[\n\\mathbb{E}[Y_i |male_i] = \\mu_0 + (\\mu_1-\\mu_0) \\times male_i.\n\\tag{4}\\]\nNow, we can use R to regress \\(income_i\\) on \\(sex_i\\) as follows.\n\nreg_model &lt;- feols(\n  income ~ sex, \n  data = sim_data\n)\n\nsummary(reg_model)\n\nOLS estimation, Dep. Var.: income\nObservations: 1,000\nStandard-errors: IID \n            Estimate Std.

R2: 0.361625\n\n\nTo verify that the linear regression above does in fact recover Equation 4, we need to check that (i) its intercept parameter equals the average income of females in the dataset and (ii) the coefficient on \\(male_i\\) is the difference in the average income of males and females in the dataset. As shown below, this is indeed the case.\n\nsim_data %&gt;%\n  filter(sex == \"Female\") %&gt;%\n  summarise(female_avg = mean(income, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n  female_avg\n1   33423.97\n\nsim_data %&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    sex_diff = mean(income[sex == \"Male\"], na.rm = TRUE) -\n                       mean(income[sex == \"Female\"], na.rm = TRUE)\n  )\n\n  sex_diff\n1 7044.472\n\n\n\n\nSaturated Regressions\nThe exercise of transforming the step-wise function in Equation 3 into a linear combination of the covariate in Equation 4 provides an important insight. It turns out that we can perform a similar transformation for any CEF where the covariates are discrete variables that take on a finite set of values.\nTODO: Add example of sex x race. Talk about main effect and interaction.\nIn general, the idea is to include a separate parameter for each possible value of the discrete covariates. The linear regression corresponding to such a CEF is said to be saturated.\nTODO: Saturated models makes inference easier: give example of comparing means."

In reality, some events can fundamentally alter the DGP (if it even exists). For example, consider the impacts of the widespread adoption of artificial intelligence. Nevertheless, we often do observe an approximately stable distribution of data over time. Thus, the fixed-DGP is often reasonable in practice and, more importantly, provides a useful framework for applying probabilistic models to learn from the data we have.↩︎\nNote that if we instead defined statistical inference as “the process of using sample data to learn about the population,” we would be describing only one specific case. It is entirely possible to have population-level data and still require statistical inference due to natural variation or measurement error.↩︎\nWhen we think of the word “prediction” we usually think of forecasts. But notice how point estimation and hypothesis testing can also be viewed as a form of prediction, as we are extrapolating from observed data to the statistical model’s parameters. This guided the choice of using “informed predictions” as the umbrella term describing inference.↩︎\nSince the number of parameters defining the distribution is finite, this is an example of a parametric statistical model.↩︎\nOne way to find such estimates is through maximum likelihood estimation.↩︎"

    "text": "Models Make Inference Possible\n\nA Set of Assumptions\nSince the true DGP is unknown, we need to make assumptions about its general structure in order to make inference feasible. A statistical model is a mathematical characterization of how the data is generated using probability theory. Specifically, we view the observed data points as realizations of a collection of random variables with some joint probability distribution. The set of assumptions that define this probability distribution — such as its functional form and the structural relationships among the random variables — is exactly what constitutes the statistical model.\n\n\nForms of Inference\nSo far, I have referred to statistical inference as involving informed predictions about unobserved features of the DGP. This is a broad umbrella term that encompasses various forms of inference, and is therefore worth clarifying.\nPerhaps the most common form of inference is point estimation. This is the process of using the observed data to produce a single “best guess” value (the point estimate) for an unknown numerical quantity that characterizes the probability distribution in the statistical model (the parameter). Another type of inference is hypothesis testing, where we use the data to assess specific claims about the model parameters. Finally, forecasting is a form of inference where the model is used to predict future realizations of the random variables.3"

    "section": "Defining the Model",
    "text": "Defining the Model\nRecall that a statistical model is simply a set of assumptions about some DGP. In this case, our DGP of interest is the joint distribution \\(F(Y, X_1, \\ldots, X_k)\\) of the outcome variable \\(Y\\) and the predictor variables \\((X_1, \\ldots, X_k)\\). However, under random sampling, it is equivalent to make assumptions about the distribution of the observations \\((Y_i, X_{i1}, \\ldots, X_{ik})\\) since they are i.i.d draws from \\(F(Y, X_1, \\ldots, X_k)\\).\n\nAssumption 1. The Linear Regression Model\n(A) (Linearity) The random variable \\(Y\\) is a linear combination of the predictor variables \\((X_1,\\ldots, X_k)\\), plus some random noise variable \\(e\\) that captures measurement error and idiosyncratic fluctuation in \\(Y\\): \\[\nY = \\beta_1X_1 + \\ldots + \\beta_kX_k + e.\n\\tag{1}\\]\n(B) (No Multicollinearity) None of the predictor variables are an exact linear combination of the other predictors.\n(C) (Zero Conditional Mean) For any given value of \\((X_1, \\ldots, X_k)\\), the noise \\(e\\) has a mean of zero: \\[\n\\mathbb{E}[e \\mid X_1, \\ldots , X_k] = 0.\n\\]\n\nIt is good practice to carefully think through what is being assumed in any given model. The linearity assumption states that (i) the functional form of the relationship between the outcome and predictors is linear in the parameters \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}=(\\beta_1, \\ldots, \\beta_k)\\), and (ii) the noise \\(e\\) is additive. The assumption of no multicollinearity is a technical assumption that ensures that there is a unique solution for the parameters. Lastly, the zero conditional mean assumption states that the conditional expectation of the noise given the predictors is zero. This is a crucial assumption of the model, and has several implications:\n\nThe conditional expectation of \\(Y\\) given \\(\\boldsymbol{X}=(X_1, \\ldots, X_k)\\) is a linear function of the realized values[^1]: \\[\n\\mathbb{E}[Y \\mid \\boldsymbol{X}] = \\boldsymbol{X}'\\beta.\n\\]\nThe noise term \\(e\\) has an unconditional mean of zero \\[\n\\mathbb{E}[e] = \\mathbb{E}[\\mathbb{E}[e \\mid \\boldsymbol{X}]] = 0.\n\\]\nThe noise term \\(e\\) is uncorrelated with the predictor variables \\[\n\\text{Cov}(e, \\boldsymbol{X}) = \\mathbb{E}[e \\boldsymbol{X}] = \\mathbb{E}\\big[\\mathbb{E}[e\\boldsymbol{X} \\mid \\boldsymbol{X}]\\big] = \\mathbb{E}\\big[\\boldsymbol{X}\\mathbb{E}[e|\\boldsymbol{X}]\\big]=0.\n\\] Intuitively, this means the noise term and predictors do not contain any information about one another.\n\nIt is also equally important to clarify what we are not assuming. First, we do not assume that \\(Y\\) is a linear function of \\((X_1, \\ldots, X_k)\\) in Equation 1; we only require that the parameters \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\) enter the equation linearly. This means that we are free to include non-linear transformations of the predictor variables in Equation 1 as long linearity in \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\) is preserved. Second, we make no assumptions about the distribution of \\(\\boldsymbol{X}\\). Third, we do not make assumptions about the distribution or variance of the noise term \\(e\\).\n\nSampling Procedure\nSince we do not observe the true data generating process \\(F(Y, X_1, \\ldots, X_k)\\), our objective is to infer the parameters \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\) in Equation 1 from the sample (observed) data. To do so, we need to make assumptions about the sampling procedure. Specifically, we will treat each observation \\((y_i, x_{i1}, \\ldots, x_{ik})\\) as realizations of the random variables \\((Y_i, X_{i1}, \\ldots, X_{ik})\\) that are drawn independently from the joint distribution \\(F(Y, X_1, \\ldots, X_k)\\).\n\nAssumption 2. Random Sampling\nThe observations \\(\\{(y_i, x_{i1}, \\ldots, x_{ik})\\}^n_{i=1}\\) are realizations of the random variables \\(\\{(Y_i, X_{i1}, \\ldots , X_{ik})\\}_{i=1}^n\\) which are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) draws from common distribution \\(F\\).\n\nIt’s easy to get confused about the notation and terminology here, so let’s clarify. The random variables \\((Y, X_1, \\ldots, X_k)\\) are theoretical objects that are used when talking about the data generating process in general. The random variables \\((Y_i, X_{1i}, \\ldots, X_{ik})\\) are the theoretical objects that correspond to each observation in the sample. Intuitively, we can think of these as the data before it was collected. The realizations \\((y_i, x_{i1}, \\ldots, x_{ik})\\) are the actual data (numbers) we observe after data collection. Viewing the observations as realizations from i.i.d random variables will allow us to use probability theory to derive the estimators of the parameters \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\) and quantify the uncertainty around them.\n\n\nRecasting in Matrix Notation\nSince the linear regression model is a set of assumptions about the DGP \\(F(Y, X_1, \\ldots, X_k)\\), we only made statements about the generic random variables \\((Y, X_1, \\ldots, X_k)\\) when first describing it. The assumption of random sampling is useful because it allows us to connect the linear regression model directly to our dataset. Specifically, we can rewrite the model as a system of \\(n\\) equations\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nY_1 &= \\beta_1 X_{11} + \\ldots + \\beta_k X_{1k} + e_1 = \\boldsymbol{X_1'}\\boldsymbol{\\beta} + e_1\\\\\\\nY_2 &= \\beta_1 X_{21}+ \\ldots + \\beta_k X_{2k} + e_2 = \\boldsymbol{X_2'}\\boldsymbol{\\beta} + e_2 \\\\\n&\\;\\;\\vdots \\\\\nY_n &= \\beta_1X_{n1} + \\ldots + \\beta_k X_{nk} + e_n= \\boldsymbol{X_n'}\\boldsymbol{\\beta} + e_n,\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{2}\\] where \\[\n\\boldsymbol{X_i} = \\begin{pmatrix} X_{i1} \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ X_{ik} \\end{pmatrix} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{k \\times 1} \\quad  \\text{and} \\quad \\boldsymbol{\\beta}= \\begin{pmatrix} \\beta_1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\beta_k \\end{pmatrix} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{k \\times 1}.\n\\]\nNote that since each observation \\((Y_i, \\boldsymbol{X_i})\\) is drawn i.i.d from \\(F(Y, \\boldsymbol{X})\\), the three assumptions of the linear regression model apply separately to each equation in the system above.\nEven more compactly, we can write the system of equations as \\[\n\\boldsymbol{Y} = \\mathbf{X}\\boldsymbol{\\beta} + \\boldsymbol{e},\n\\] where \\[\n\\boldsymbol{Y} = \\begin{pmatrix} Y_1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ Y_n \\end{pmatrix} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times 1}, \\quad \\boldsymbol{e} = \\begin{pmatrix} e_1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ e_n \\end{pmatrix} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times 1}, \\quad  \\mathbf{X} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\boldsymbol{X_1'} \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\boldsymbol{X_n'} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} X_{11} & \\ldots & X_{1k} \\\\ \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\ X_{n1} & \\ldots & X_{nk} \\end{pmatrix} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times k}.\n\\]\nThe quantity \\(\\mathbf{X}\\)1 is called the design matrix.2\n\n\nRevisiting the Assumptions\nThe matrix representation of the linear regression model is useful because it helps us interpret the model in terms of our data and better understand the practical implications of the assumptions being made.\nLet’s revisit the zero conditional mean assumption. This assumption states that the error term has a conditional mean of zero given all the predictors. In matrix form, this is written as \\[\n\\mathbb{E}[e_i \\mid \\mathbf{X}] = \\mathbb{E}[e_i \\mid \\boldsymbol{X}_1, \\ldots, \\boldsymbol{X}_n] = 0 \\quad \\forall \\quad i = 1, \\ldots, n.\n\\tag{3}\\] This representation of the assumption emphasizes that the mean is conditional on the predictors of all the observations. We will refer to Equation 3 as the strict exogeneity condition.\nBy the random sampling assumption, we have that \\[\n(Y_i, \\boldsymbol{X}_i) \\perp (Y_j, \\boldsymbol{X}_j) \\quad \\forall \\quad i \\neq j.\n\\]\nNow, since the error term is a function of the outcome and predictors \\[\ne_i = Y_i - \\boldsymbol{X_i'}\\boldsymbol{\\beta} = f(Y_i, \\boldsymbol{X_i}) \\quad \\forall \\quad i = 1, \\ldots, n,\n\\] and independence is preserved under transformations, we have \\[\n(e_i, \\boldsymbol{X_i}) \\perp (e_j, \\boldsymbol{X_j}) \\quad \\forall \\quad i \\neq j.\n\\]\nNow, since \\((Y_i, \\boldsymbol{X}_i) \\perp (Y_j, \\boldsymbol{X}_j)\\) for all \\(i \\neq j\\) by the random sampling assumption, it follows that \\[\n(e_i, \\boldsymbol{X_i}) \\perp (e_j, \\boldsymbol{X_j}) \\quad \\forall \\quad i \\neq j,\n\\]\nIt’s also useful to revisit the no multicollinearity assumption. Recall from linear algebra that a rectangular matrix has a left inverse if and only if all of its columns are linearly independent (i.e. the matrix has full column rank). Since we assume no multicollinearity, this means that the design matrix \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) has full column rank3, and therefore has a left inverse. This, as we will see, is useful in deriving the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator for the parameters."

First note that we can stack Equation 1 as a system of \\(n\\) equations\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nY_1 &= \\beta_1 X_{11} + \\ldots + \\beta_k X_{1k} + e_1 = \\boldsymbol{X_1'}\\boldsymbol{\\beta} + e_1\\\\\\\nY_2 &= \\beta_1 X_{21}+ \\ldots + \\beta_k X_{2k} + e_2 = \\boldsymbol{X_2'}\\boldsymbol{\\beta} + e_2 \\\\\n&\\;\\;\\vdots \\\\\nY_n &= \\beta_1X_{n1} + \\ldots + \\beta_k X_{nk} + e_n= \\boldsymbol{X_n'}\\boldsymbol{\\beta} + e_n,\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] where \\[\n\\boldsymbol{X_i} = \\begin{pmatrix} X_{i1} \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ X_{ik} \\end{pmatrix} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{k \\times 1} \\quad  \\text{and} \\quad \\boldsymbol{\\beta}= \\begin{pmatrix} \\beta_1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\beta_k \\end{pmatrix} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{k \\times 1}.\n\\]\nNow, we can collapse this system of equations into a single matrix equation: \\[\n\\boldsymbol{Y} = \\mathbf{X}\\boldsymbol{\\beta} + \\boldsymbol{e},\n\\tag{3}\\] where \\[\n\\boldsymbol{Y} = \\begin{pmatrix} Y_1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ Y_n \\end{pmatrix} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times 1}, \\quad \\boldsymbol{e} = \\begin{pmatrix} e_1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ e_n \\end{pmatrix} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times 1}, \\quad  \\mathbf{X} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\boldsymbol{X_1'} \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\boldsymbol{X_n'} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} X_{11} & \\ldots & X_{1k} \\\\ \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\ X_{n1} & \\ldots & X_{nk} \\end{pmatrix} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times k}.\n\\]\nThe quantity \\(\\mathbf{X}\\)2 is called the design matrix.3\n\nInterpreting the Assumptions\nIt is good practice to carefully think through what is being assumed in any given model. The linearity assumption in Equation 1 and Equation 3 states that (i) the functional form of the relationship between the outcome and predictors is linear in the parameters \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}=(\\beta_1, \\ldots, \\beta_k)\\), and (ii) the error \\(e\\) is additive.\nThe assumption of no multicollinearity ensures that the design matrix \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) has full column rank.4 This in turn means the square matrix \\(\\mathbf{X}'\\mathbf{X}\\) is invertible, which is a crucial property when deriving the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator for the parameters.\nThe strict exogeneity assumption states that the conditional expectation of the error given the predictors of all observations is zero. This is a crucial assumption of the model, and has several implications:\n\nThe unconditional mean of the error term is zero: \\[\n\\mathbb{E}[e_i] = \\mathbb{E}[\\mathbb{E}[e_i \\mid \\mathbf{X}]] = 0 \\quad \\forall \\, i,\n\\tag{4}\\] where the first equality follows from the law of iterated expectations.\nThe predictors are orthogonal to the error term for all observations: \\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\mathbb{E}[X_{jk}e_i]\n\\overset{(a)}{=} \\mathbb{E}[\\mathbb{E}(X_{jk}e_i \\mid X_{jk})]\n\\overset{(b)}{=} \\mathbb{E}[X_{jk} \\mathbb{E}[e_i \\mid X_{jk}]]  \n\\overset{(c)}{=} 0 \\quad \\forall \\, i,j,k,\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{5}\\] where \\((a)\\) uses the law of iterated expectations, \\((b)\\) uses the linearity of expectations, and \\((c)\\) follows from the fact that \\[\n\\mathbb{E}[e_i \\mid X_{jk} ]= \\mathbb{E}\\big[\\mathbb{E}[e_i \\mid \\mathbf{X} ] \\mid X_{jk}\\big] =0\n\\] by the generalized law of iterated expectations.\nThe error term \\(e_i\\) is uncorrelated with the predictor variables of all observations: \\[\n\\text{Cov}(e_i, X_{jk})\n\\overset{(a)}{=} \\mathbb{E}[e_iX_{jk}] - \\mathbb{E}[e_i]\\mathbb{E}[x_{jk}]\n\\overset{(b)}{=} \\mathbb{E}[e_iX_{jk}]\n\\overset{(c)}{=} 0\n\\quad \\forall \\, i,j,k,\n\\] where \\((a)\\) is the definition, \\((b)\\) uses Equation 4, and \\((c)\\) uses Equation 5. Intuitively, this means the error term and predictors do not contain any information about one another.\nThe conditional expectation of \\(\\boldsymbol{Y}\\) given \\(\\mathbf{X}\\), called the regression of \\(\\boldsymbol{Y}\\) on \\(\\mathbf{X}\\), is a linear function of the realized values: \\[\n\\mathbb{E}[\\boldsymbol{Y} \\mid \\mathbf{X}] = \\mathbb{E}[\\mathbf{X}\\beta + \\boldsymbol{e} \\mid \\mathbf{X}]=\\mathbb{E}[{\\mathbf{X}\\beta \\mid  \\mathbf{X}}]=\\mathbf{X}\\beta.\n\\]\n\nIt is important to note that the random sampling assumption relaxes implications \\((2)\\) and \\((3)\\) above. Specifically, we have that \\[\n(Y_i, \\boldsymbol{X}_i) \\perp (Y_j, \\boldsymbol{X}_j) \\quad \\forall \\quad i \\neq j.\n\\]\nNow, since the error term is a function of the outcome and predictors \\[\ne_i = Y_i - \\boldsymbol{X_i'}\\boldsymbol{\\beta} = f(Y_i, \\boldsymbol{X_i}) \\quad \\forall \\quad i = 1, \\ldots, n,\n\\] and independence is preserved under transformations, we have \\[\n(e_i, \\boldsymbol{X_i}) \\perp (e_j, \\boldsymbol{X_j}) \\quad \\forall \\quad i \\neq j.\n\\]\nIt is also equally as important to clarify what we are not assuming. First, we do not assume that \\(Y\\) is a linear function of \\((X_1, \\ldots, X_k)\\) in Equation 1; we only require that the parameters \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\) enter the equation linearly. This means that we are free to include non-linear transformations of the predictor variables in Equation 1 as long linearity in \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\) is preserved. Second, we make no assumptions about the distribution of \\(\\boldsymbol{X}\\). Third, we do not make assumptions about the distribution or variance of the error term \\(e\\)."
