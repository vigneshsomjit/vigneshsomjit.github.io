    "text": "Linear Regression Can (Sometimes) Recover True Conditional Averages\nSo far, we have discussed linear regression as a tool to approximate the conditional expectation function. However, it can be shown that when the CEF is itself linear, the best linear predictor exactly equals the CEF. That is to say linear regression recovers the true conditional averages in this case.2\nTo see this in practice, I simulate data on income using the following equation\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nincome_i &= \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\times white_i + \\beta_2 \\times male_i \\\\ & \\quad \\quad + \\beta_3 \\times literacy_i^{(1+0.3 \\times sex_i)} + \\beta_4 (male_i \\times black_i) + \\varepsilon_i.\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\nShow the code that simulates the dataset.\nset.seed(123)\n\n# Population size \nn &lt;- 1000\n\n# Noise \nnoise &lt;- rnorm(n, 0, 2000)\n\n# Covariates \nmale &lt;- rbinom(n, 1, 0.5)\nsex &lt;- factor(male, labels = c(\"Female\", \"Male\"))\nwhite &lt;- rbinom(n, 1, 0.7)\nrace &lt;- factor(white, labels = c(\"Black\", \"White\"))\nliteracy &lt;- runif(n, 0, 100)\n\n# Outcome \nwhite_female_base &lt;- 30000                           # white females with 0 literacy earn 30000\nliteracy_effect &lt;- 50\nmale_premium &lt;- 200                                    # + 200 male premium \nwhite_premium &lt;- 1500                                  # + 1500 white premium\nwhite_male_premium &lt;- 1000                              # + 1000 white male premium \n\n# Create income \nincome &lt;- \n  white_female_base +\n  white_premium       * white +                          \n  male_premium        * male +                            \n  literacy_effect   * (literacy^(1 + 0.3 * male)) +    # literate males are better off than literate females \n  white_male_premium   * (male * white) +                  \n  noise\n\n# Combine into a dataset\nsim_data &lt;- data.frame(sex = sex,\n                     race = race,\n                     literacy,\n                     income)\n\n\n\nA Simple Univariate Example\nRecall from Equation 1 that the CEF is a function of the covariates we use to predict the outcome variable. So, as a simple example of a linear CEF, let us consider the conditional expectation of \\(income_i\\) as a function of \\(male_i\\). The conditional expectation can be written as the step-wise function \\[\n\\mathbb{E}[Y_i|male_i] = \\begin{cases} \\mu_0 \\quad  \\text{if} \\quad male_i = 0 \\\\ \\mu_1 \\quad  \\text{if} \\quad male_i = 1 \\end{cases}.\n\\tag{3}\\] To illustrate that Equation 3 is a linear combination of \\(male_i\\), we can rewrite it as\n\\[\n\\mathbb{E}[Y_i |male_i] = \\mu_0 + (\\mu_1-\\mu_0) \\times male_i.\n\\tag{4}\\]\nNow, we can use R to regress \\(income_i\\) on \\(sex_i\\) as follows.\n\nreg_model &lt;- feols(\n  income ~ sex, \n  data = sim_data\n)\n\nsummary(reg_model)\n\nOLS estimation, Dep. Var.: income\nObservations: 1,000\nStandard-errors: IID \n            Estimate Std.

R2: 0.361625\n\n\nTo verify that the linear regression above does in fact recover Equation 4, we need to check that (i) its intercept parameter equals the average income of females in the dataset and (ii) the coefficient on \\(male_i\\) is the difference in the average income of males and females in the dataset. As shown below, this is indeed the case.\n\nsim_data %&gt;%\n  filter(sex == \"Female\") %&gt;%\n  summarise(female_avg = mean(income, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n  female_avg\n1   33423.97\n\nsim_data %&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    sex_diff = mean(income[sex == \"Male\"], na.rm = TRUE) -\n                       mean(income[sex == \"Female\"], na.rm = TRUE)\n  )\n\n  sex_diff\n1 7044.472\n\n\n\n\nSaturated Regressions\nThe exercise of transforming the step-wise function in Equation 3 into a linear combination of the covariate in Equation 4 provides an important insight. It turns out that we can perform a similar transformation for any CEF where the covariates are discrete variables that take on a finite set of values.\nTODO: Add example of sex x race. Talk about main effect and interaction.\nIn general, the idea is to include a separate parameter for each possible value of the discrete covariates. The linear regression corresponding to such a CEF is said to be saturated.\nTODO: Saturated models makes inference easier: give example of comparing means."

In reality, some events can fundamentally alter the DGP (if it even exists). For example, consider the impacts of the widespread adoption of artificial intelligence. Nevertheless, we often do observe an approximately stable distribution of data over time. Thus, the fixed-DGP is often reasonable in practice and, more importantly, provides a useful framework for applying probabilistic models to learn from the data we have.↩︎\nNote that if we instead defined statistical inference as “the process of using sample data to learn about the population,” we would be describing only one specific case. It is entirely possible to have population-level data and still require statistical inference due to natural variation or measurement error.↩︎\nWhen we think of the word “prediction” we usually think of forecasts. But notice how point estimation and hypothesis testing can also be viewed as a form of prediction, as we are extrapolating from observed data to the statistical model’s parameters. This guided the choice of using “informed predictions” as the umbrella term describing inference.↩︎"

    "text": "Models Make Inference Possible\n\nA Set of Assumptions\nSince the true DGP is unknown, we need to make assumptions about its general structure in order to make inference feasible. A statistical model is a mathematical characterization of how the data is generated using probability theory. Specifically, we view the observed data points as realizations of a collection of random variables with some joint probability distribution. The set of assumptions that define this probability distribution — such as its functional form and the structural relationships among the random variables — is exactly what constitutes the statistical model.\n\n\nForms of Inference\nSo far, I have referred to statistical inference as involving informed predictions about unobserved features of the DGP. This is a broad umbrella term that encompasses various forms of inference, and is therefore worth clarifying.\nPerhaps the most common form of inference is point estimation. This is the process of using the observed data to produce a single “best guess” value (the point estimate) for an unknown numerical quantity that characterizes the probability distribution in the statistical model (the parameter). Another type of inference is hypothesis testing, where we use the data to assess specific claims about the model parameters. Finally, forecasting is a form of inference where the model is used to predict future realizations of the random variables.3"
