## Likelihood Function 

[Recall](statistical-modeling.qmd) that in a statistical model, we view our dataset $\mathbf{X}=\{X_{i1}, \ldots, X_{iK}\}_{i=1}^n$ as a collection of random variables with some unknown joint distribution $F(X_1, \ldots, X_K)$. A **parametric** statistical model assumes that the joint distribution generating the data belongs to a family of distributions that are fully described by a finite number of parameters. For example, the family of normal distributions
$$
\mathcal{F}= \{ \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2) : \mu \in \mathbb{R}, \sigma^2 > 0 \}
$$

is a parametric family fully described by two parameters: the mean $\mu$ and the variance $\sigma^2$.


Suppose we are using a parametric model to describe how our dataset is generated. In this context, the **likelihood** is the joint probability mass (if discrete) or density (if continuous) of the observed data under different parameter values of the parametric model being used. More formally, the **likelihood function** is the joint probability distribution of the dataset viewed as a function of the parameters of the model: 

$$
L(\theta | \mathbf{X}) = f(\mathbf{X} | \theta)
$$
