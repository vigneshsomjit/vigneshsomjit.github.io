I am a Research Professional at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, where I work with Professor [Richard Hornbeck](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/faculty/directory/h/richard-hornbeck). Before joining Booth, I received my B.A. in Economics (with honors) and B.A. in Mathematics from Boston University in 2025. I maintain a [research blog](blog/blog-index.html), where I write about econometrics, causal inference, and machine learning.
